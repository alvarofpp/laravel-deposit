# How to contribute
In addition to the basic procedures for good practices of contribution in projects:

1. Create a folder with your files in `warehouse/`, **remember to follow the structure of a project in Laravel**.
1. In the your folder, create a `README.md` with the title, description and some details of the your contribution.
1. Update the lists in [`README.md`](../README.md) and [`../warehouse/README.md`](warehouse/README.md).

You can pick up as an example the folder [`example/`](../example/) or the contributions existing in this repository.
